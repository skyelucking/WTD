# Winning The Day

## Description
Creating new habits is hard. They say it take 21 days to create or break a habit. However, we made it easy for you. With our application, you can set goals to track your habits a week at a time. 

21 days can seem a little overwhelming. But when you break it up into small chunks, it leads to big results. 
You can choose from a selected cateorgy of habits or create your own habits to track at [Winning The Day](https://winning-the-day.herokuapp.com/).

Are you ready to create or breaks some habits? 

PLEASE NOTE: 
Whatever habits you might be struggling to break or create, know that we are rooting for you.
